        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>For years I created as much as I possibly could. I had written music with my friends, shot photos for many musicians and bands, and even found myself working on websites for my friends' businesses in my free time. Being this jack of all trades, I realized I had the potential for something more.</p> 
        <p>Since then I've written and recorded a couple of records with a local alternative rock producer, had my photos published in some high-circulation publications, and garnered millions of views of videos uploaded to YouTube. Now a decade later, I'm taking on my most technical goal to date. I want to create and code.</p>
        <p>You can find me at home in Winter Park, Florida.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I ultimately want to become a software developer over the next decade and create innovations for musicians and photographers, but right now I'm focused in on collaborating other creatives and business owners and I'm really interested in becoming a well-versed full stack developer.</p>
        <p>Some areas I'm looking to increase my knowledge:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Sass</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
          <li>jQuery</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>Angular</li>
          <li>Vue</li>
          <li>Node</li>
          <li>Agile</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Iâ€™d like build a quality curated portfolio to work for an innovative company with an established internal and external culture.</p>
